      <p> GovWifi is an authentication service running in the cloud that makes all participating wifi networks appear as one. Organisations configure their wifi infrastructure to access the GovWifi authentication service using the RADIUS open standard.
      </p>


      <p> Each end user is protected with unique credentials and encryption keys when they log in to the service. These credentials are randomly generated preventing them being used to access other systems if stolen.
      </p>


      <p> Once logged in, users can access their resources in the same way they would if they were working away from the office. Depending on requirements, users may need to use a virtual private network. Users’ devices are isolated from other devices to stop the spread of malware and protect secure devices from insecure ones.
      </p>


      <p> The network also identifies itself in a way that can’t be spoofed, adding to the safety measures that protect it from potential attacks.
