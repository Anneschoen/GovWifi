        Costs
      </h2>
      <p> There is no cost to set up GovWifi, as it runs on existing wireless infrastructure. It’s managed centrally by Government Digital Service (GDS), which covers the running costs for the platform. GovWifi can also save organisations money by removing the need for a separate guest wifi network.
          Average costs for maintaining: £ 384.00 per month
